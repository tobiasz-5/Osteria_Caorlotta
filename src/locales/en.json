      "testo_1": "Welcome to Osteria Caorlotta. We are Alika and Pietro, the heart and soul of this special place. A young couple from Caorle, a picturesque fishing village overlooking the Upper Adriatic, we decided to bring a piece of our homeland here to Florence. Caorle is a charming town rich in traditions, with a historic center that, with its narrow streets, resembles a small Venice. Here, fishing is more than an activity: itâ€™s a centuries-old tradition passed down from generation to generation, deeply rooted in the lagoon and the waters of the Upper Adriatic.",
      "testo_2": "In 2022, we made our dream come true by moving to Florence and opening the doors of Osteria Caorlotta. Our goal is to offer you a unique culinary journey, where Venetian tradition meets modernity and a genuine love for good food. Let Pietro guide you: since childhood he has absorbed the culinary and fishing arts from his family of fishermen and restaurateurs. With passion and great care, he selects fresh fish and authentic ingredients daily, creating dishes that honor both tradition and seasonality. At the table, Alika will welcome you with her warm and attentive service, making you feel right at home while enhancing every dish with our curated wine selection. Our food philosophy is simple and clear: to bring the sea to your table in its most authentic form, respecting its flavors and traditions with a touch of modern flair.",
      "testo_3": "Seasonality guides our menu, highlighting fresh and genuine seafood and produce. Whether it's classic Venetian recipes like baccalÃ  mantecato, saor, moeche, moscardini, canestrelli, scampi alla busara, or broetto, or innovative dishes, fish will always be the true star. Our offerings include raw seafood, both intriguing and aphrodisiac, as well as fish prepared with salt, baked, or grilled â€” the undisputed protagonists of our cuisine.",
      "testo_4": "Located along the Arno River, just a few steps from Ponte Vecchio, Osteria Caorlotta welcomes you into a historic and charming setting. The venue features an original 18th-century mosaic floor from the Lorraine period and walls adorned with 20th-century frescoes depicting elegant scenes of conviviality. The unique and evocative atmosphere makes every visit romantic, intimate, and absolutely unforgettable."
