      "testo_1": "Our story, ladies and gentlemen â€” welcome to Osteria Caorlotta! We are Alika and Pietro, the hearts and minds behind this extraordinary restaurant. We come from Caorle, an ancient small town on the Adriatic Sea in the province of Venice. This picturesque spot thrives on fishing and tourism, thanks to the beauty of its historic center and narrow alleys reminiscent of a little Venice. Fifteen kilometers of beach invite us to discover not only the coastline and the Upper Adriatic but also the surrounding nature, including the lagoon with its vast variety of fish that grace the tables of Osteria Caorlotta.",
      "testo_2": "Our mission? Itâ€™s simple: to offer fresh fish, prepared in its purest form and with respect. We want to bring the traditions and culture of our sea to the table, with a dash of modernity. From the moment we decided to move to Florence, we rolled up our sleeves and, with determination, embarked on what was once just a dream â€” the goal of our life. At the end of 2022, we opened the doors of Osteria Caorlotta in Florence, determined to provide a unique and unforgettable gastronomic journey where tradition and a love of cooking blend perfectly.",
      "testo_3": "We are a young couple with two different visions, yet together we are shaping the essence of Osteria Caorlotta.",
      "testo_4": "Let yourself be guided by the culinary creations of Pietro Benvenuti. Born into a family of restaurateurs and fishermen, he absorbed, from a young age, the gastronomic and fishing traditions of our land. Each day, with care and passion, he selects fresh catch and genuine ingredients to compose exquisite dishes, always honoring the raw materials with dedication.",
      "testo_5": "In a paradisiacal and picturesque setting along the Lungarno, let yourself be pampered by Alika Antoniolli. Rediscover the pleasure of dining, enhanced by attentive service that aims to spoil and delight you with the flavors and aromas of our dishes and our selection of wines. Allow yourself to explore new tastes so we can offer you new emotions...",
      "testo_6": "We wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to you, dear customers â€” now friends â€” for placing your trust in us. We draw inspiration from you for each new step forward."
