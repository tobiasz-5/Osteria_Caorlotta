      "testo_1": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Osteria Caorlotta. We are Alika and Pietro, the hearts and minds behind this extraordinary restaurant.\nWe are a young couple from Caorle, an ancient small village washed by the Adriatic Sea in the province of Venice. Strongly tied to fishing and tourism, thanks to the beauty of its historic center and narrow alleys. The history of the town is linked to fishing, not only as a productive activity but as a true tradition passed down from father to son, with roots in the lagoon and the Upper Adriatic. A picturesque town, deeply bound to fishing, from which it draws its identity, passed down through generations. Thanks to its historic beauty and alleys, it resembles a little Venice. 15 kilometers of beach accompany us in discovering the coastline and the Upper Adriatic, which offers a great variety of fish that arrive at the tables of the osteria.",
      "testo_2": "Once we decided to move to Florence, we rolled up our sleeves and, with determination, set out on what had always been our dream: opening the doors of Osteria Caorlotta in Florence. Since 2022, weâ€™ve been offering a unique and inimitable gastronomic journey where tradition and love for cooking blend perfectly. Let Pietro's culinary creations guide you. Born into a family of restaurateurs and fishermen, he has absorbed, since childhood, the culinary and fishing traditions of our land. With care and passion, he selects fresh catch and genuine ingredients every day to create delicious dishes that respect the raw materials. Rediscover the joy of dining with the attentive service of Alika, who aims to pamper you and delight your senses with flavors and aromas paired with our selection of wines. Our proposal? Simple: offer fresh fish in its simplicity and prepare it with care. Bring to the table the traditions and culture of our sea with a touch of modernity.",
      "testo_3": "We let the seasonality of fish and produce guide us in crafting our menu. Whether traditional or contemporary dishes, fish will always be the star of our offering. There will always be a nod to tradition, with dishes like creamed cod, saor, moeche, baby octopus, canestrelli, scampi alla busara, and broetto, without forgetting a pinch of cosmopolitan flavor and modern flair. Not to mention our aphrodisiac raw selections and our fish baked in salt, in the oven, or grilled â€” true highlights of our kitchen.",
      "testo_4": "Osteria Caorlotta is located just steps from the Ponte Vecchio, in a historic venue along the Arno, paved with an original 18th-century mosaic from the Lorraine era and surrounded by frescoed walls from the early 1900s, depicting convivial banquets and young maidens. It is a place with a unique atmosphere, making every meal a romantic, intimate, and unforgettable experience."
